    <p>Hear (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a podcast-based language-learning application. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights under applicable privacy laws such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA.</p>

<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> email address, listening data, technical data, subscription information, and translation text when you use translation features.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> account creation, verification, providing learning features, subscription management, app improvement, and (in the future) optional marketing emails (only with your consent).</li>
    <li><strong>Third parties:</strong> Supabase, RevenueCat, Google ML Kit, Google Cloud Translation, Podcast Index, FFmpeg.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> encryption in transit, restricted access.</li>
    <li><strong>Rights:</strong> GDPR and CCPA rights, including deletion and access.</li>
    <li><strong>Children:</strong> Not for users under 13.</li>
    <li><strong>No data sales:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Information We Collect and Why</h2>

<h3>2.1 Account Information</h3>
<p><strong>Email Address:</strong><br>
We collect your email when you create an account. We use it for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account creation</li>
    <li>Email verification</li>
    <li>Essential service notifications (password reset, security alerts)</li>
    <li><strong>Future marketing emails, only if you opt in</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Legal basis (GDPR):</em> performance of a contract (account functionality), legitimate interest (security), and consent (marketing emails).</p>

<h3>2.2 Listening and Usage Data</h3>
<p>We collect listening activity and app usage metrics necessary to provide learning features. This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Episodes you listen to</li>
    <li>Time spent listening</li>
    <li>Episode completion percentage and playback position</li>
    <li>Learning progress metrics (e.g., repetition behavior, session durations, progress paths)</li>
    <li>In-app interactions (features used, buttons pressed)</li>
    <li>Session metadata (timestamps, approximate location derived from IP for localization only)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why we collect it:</strong> to track progress, personalize recommendations, improve the app, debug issues, and maintain service integrity.</p>
<p><strong>We do NOT:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Record your microphone audio</li>
    <li>Collect or store voice samples</li>
    <li>Analyze personal conversations</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Local Storage (On Your Device)</h3>
<p>Hear stores some information locally on your device for performance and offline usage, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cached podcast episodes or downloaded audio for offline listening</li>
    <li>Playback position and episode bookmarks</li>
    <li>Temporary learning-related data for the current session</li>
    <li>User settings and preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>This local data does not leave your device unless you choose features (such as cloud sync) that upload it to your account.</p>

<h3>2.4 Translation Text (Google Cloud Translation)</h3>
<p>When you use Hear’s translation features (for UI text, podcast metadata translation, subtitle/transcript translation, or user-submitted text to be translated), the text you submit is transmitted to <strong>Google Cloud Translation</strong> to perform the translation.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What is sent:</strong> only the text that you request to be translated (e.g., episode descriptions, interface text, transcripts you request translation for). We do <strong>not</strong> automatically send full audio files to the translation API.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> to provide translations that improve your language learning experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Processor role:</strong> Google Cloud Translation acts as a data processor for these translation requests. Google may process and temporarily store the translated text in accordance with its policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> If you do not want your text sent to Google Cloud Translation, do not use the translation feature; you can still use Hear without enabling translations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.5 Payment / Subscription Data</h3>
<p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscription entitlements. RevenueCat may receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anonymous app user IDs</li>
    <li>Subscription status (active, expired)</li>
    <li>Purchase receipts (from Apple/Google)</li>
    <li>Country/region information</li>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> receive your full payment card numbers; payment processing is handled by the app stores or your payment provider.</p>

<h3>2.6 Technical and Device Information</h3>
<p>Automatically collected data includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IP address (used for localization and security)</li>
    <li>Device model and OS version</li>
    <li>Crash logs and error diagnostics</li>
    <li>App version and usage metrics</li>
    <li>Authentication metadata</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> debugging, security, analytics, and service optimization.</p>

<h2>3. Where and How We Store Your Data</h2>
<p>All backend data is stored and processed using:</p>
<h3>Supabase (Backend &amp; Database)</h3>
<p>Supabase stores your account and listening data, including email, listening progress, and preferences. Data may be processed in regions determined by Supabase. We have contractual safeguards with Supabase to protect your data and to honor data-subject rights. For transfers outside the EEA, we rely on appropriate legal safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) as needed.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We share only the minimum required data with trusted third-party service providers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase (backend &amp; database):</strong> stores account, listening data, and metadata; acts as our processor.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat (subscription management):</strong> validates purchases and manages entitlements.</li>
    <li><strong>Google ML Kit (on-device ML):</strong> used primarily on device for language-learning features; limited data is sent off-device only if explicitly required and with your consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Cloud Translation:</strong> performs translations for texts you request translated. Text you submit for translation is sent to Google Cloud Translation and processed according to Google’s policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Podcast Index:</strong> used to fetch podcast metadata and artwork; does not receive your personal data as part of metadata requests.</li>
    <li><strong>FFmpeg:</strong> used for media processing/transcoding; processing occurs locally or on our servers and does not independently collect or transmit personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Other providers:</strong> analytics, crash reporting, email delivery — only required data is shared.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data or share it with advertisers. We will disclose information when required by law or to protect users or our rights.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Active accounts:</strong> We retain email and listening data while your account is active.</li>
    <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> On deletion requests, we remove your profile, email, and listening data from live systems. Backups may retain copies for a limited period (typically up to 30 days) for recovery or legal reasons; backups are deleted per our retention schedule.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal holds:</strong> If required by law or to resolve disputes, certain data may be retained longer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR, CCPA)</h2>
<h3>EU / EEA (GDPR)</h3>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access your data</li>
    <li>Rectify inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Request deletion (right to be forgotten)</li>
    <li>Restrict processing</li>
    <li>Object to processing (including profiling based on legitimate interests)</li>
    <li>Request portability of your data</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is consent-based</li>
</ul>

<h3>California (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
<p>California residents have the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Know categories of personal information collected and the purposes</li>
    <li>Access specific pieces of personal information</li>
    <li>Request deletion of personal information (subject to exceptions)</li>
    <li>Opt out of sale of personal information (we do not sell it)</li>
    <li>Limit use of sensitive personal information</li>
</ul>
<p>We will verify requests and respond within applicable statutory timeframes.</p>

<h2>7. How to Submit a Privacy Request</h2>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:account@hearapp.me">account@hearapp.me</a> and include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your full name</li>
    <li>The email associated with your account</li>
    <li>Type of request (access, deletion, export, objection)</li>
</ul>
<p>We may request additional information to verify your identity and protect your data.</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit, Supabase security policies, role-based access controls, and secure subscription validation. No system is completely secure; if a breach occurs we will notify affected users and authorities as required.</p>

<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Hear is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under the applicable age without parental consent, we will delete it.</p>

<h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Because we use third-party providers (Supabase, Google services, RevenueCat), your data may be processed in countries outside your home jurisdiction. For transfers from the EEA, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms.</p>

<h2>11. Open-Source &amp; Third-Party Attributions</h2>
<p>Hear uses open-source libraries and third-party tools under their respective licenses (e.g., FFmpeg). We maintain an attributions list inside the app or on our website. Open-source projects do not receive your personal data as part of standard use.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via in-app notices and by updating the “Last updated” date. Continued use of Hear after changes indicates acceptance.</p>

<h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions or want to exercise your privacy rights:</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:account@hearapp.me">account@hearapp.me</a></p>

<h2>14. Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is a template based on your provided details and good-faith practices. It is <strong>not legal advice</strong>. Laws vary by jurisdiction and change over time. We recommend review by legal counsel familiar with privacy law applicable to your users (GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, etc.) before publishing.</p>
